                            &emsp; I have always liked learning about math and science, and engineering fit my interests. I mainly like to work with physical components and products, and electrical engineering 
                            helped me to learn about electrical components and how to use them to build amazing things. I am part of the robotics club at my school and my group makes toaster-sized robots 
                            for competitions against other colleges. Each year we design two robots and manufacture them in our school's machine shop. I mainly work on the software side dealing with human 
                            and autonomous controls for driving and all other functions of the robot. We use a game console style controller, one per robot. My team has actually been able to qualify for a 
                            world competition spot and the competition is held in Texas. However, due to some internal issues with the school, we have not been able to attend.

                                    &emsp; For a recent class, two other friends and I made our own simple synthetic keyboard. We used a microcontroller board called a NUCLEO and other components that were part of our lab kit. 
                                    Additionally, we bought a pair of small speakers from Amazon. The components for the project included a LCD screen, a digital to analog converter, an amplifier, and push buttons. 
                                    I mainly worked on the hardware portion of the project with wiring and making an enclosure so our project looked good and did not fall apart. There are 17 keys in total, which 
                                    equates to around an octave and a half of keys. We used mainly a version of C for the code with an IDE called STM32. There were some improvements we could have made, but ran out 
                                    of time to complete those extra tasks.

                            &emsp; I like to build plastic models in my spare time, starting from around 2016 when I built my first model. I like it because at the end, I have 
                            something physical that I can either display or mess with. I really like working with physical objects, and building models helps me to keep my hands 
                            moving and creating something that I can show off once I finish.

                            &emsp; Recently, I started learning how to 3D print using a FDM printer. The printer uses PLA spools of plastic and melts the plastic to create layers. There are programs that 
                            can take a full model and seperate it into printed layers for the printer to use. I usually just download things off the internet but I began looking into creating some 3D 
                            models on my own using CAD, or computer aided design.

                            &emsp; I started going to the archery club at my school and went to shoots at the local shooting range in town. I wanted to try some kind of physical activity to give me 
                            a break from school. I learned about the archery club by looking at my school's club list and the barrier to entry was low. I mainly participate casually along with some friends
