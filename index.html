                        <p> 
                            I have always liked learning about math and science, and engineering fit my interests. I mainly like to work with physical components and products, and electrical engineering 
                            helped me to learn about electrical components and how to use them to build amazing things. I am part of the robotics club at my school and my group makes toaster-sized robots 
                            for competitions against other colleges. Each year we design two robots and manufacture them in our school's machine shop. I mainly work on the software side dealing with human 
                            and autonomous controls for driving and all other functions of the robot. We use a game console style controller, one per robot. My team has actually been able to qualify for a 
                            world competition spot and the competition is held in Texas. However, due to some internal issues with the school, we have not been able to attend.

                            I want to learn coding as I think it will help me in my career and just be generally useful in the future. Coding is a very large part of today's society and I want to learn it
                            so I have the skills and knowledge to apply myself in the field. I also want more things to put on my resume to help me get a job out of college and the projects through this
                            bootcamp will help me in that regard as well. I think it would be god for me to learn both ends of a computer system, from the hardware in school to the software here. I would
                            also like to gain more experience in coding to boost my confidence in my skills and help me in the future.

                                        A parter and I were able to implement a vision based pick and place algorithm for a robot arm. The robot arm is a 4 degree of freedom arm (meaning it has 4 joints)
                                        and was able to be controlled with Python code. The camera used was the Intel Realsense camera, which also had a Python library. The camera would scan for circles
                                        continuously and use HSV (hue, saturation, value) to classify the spheres into their respective colors. The robot moved with trajectory generation, meaning a path 
                                        was created from its initial point to intermediate points. The robot would move from a home position to a position above the ball, the pick it up. From the ball's 
                                        location, the robot would move to a preassigned bin depending on the color of the ball. This process involved solving for and implementing forward, inverse, and 
                                        velocity kinematics to provide control over the joints and how they moved. The camera implementation covered using Hough transforms to detect circles in an image 
                                        and detecting if the circle's center was inside of the workspace. The camera also used a PNP algorithm to convert what it saw into the robot's frame of reference.

                                        <br>
                                        We were also able to develop visual servoding for this robot arm using PID controls. The PID controller stands for position, integral, and derivative and uses the 
                                        error between the current position and the target position to determine how fast the robot would move. The implementation for this involved using AprilTags to create 
                                        a point cloud localization for the robot to determine the AprilTag position in the robot frame of reference. This point cloud method would also serve to initialize 
                                        the robot for the pick and place algorithm. An AprilTag was detected as the target position for the robot to move to, and was able to follow the AprilTag as long as 
                                        it stayed within the robot's physical range.

                                        Another project I was involved in was for my mobile robotics class. I was working with a partner to code autonomous routines for a small two wheeled robot in C.
                                        The goal of some algorithms was to follow a black line on a white background. The first of these algorithms was PID control with the error being the difference 
                                        between two light sensors. The robot would always be moving forward and if one of the sensors detected the black line, it would move in the direction away from 
                                        the line. The second algorithm was a neural network implementation mimicking the PID control. The network used was a 5 node neural network with 3 hidden nodes 
                                        and 2 outer nodes. The outer nodes would be used to directly control the motors of the robot. To train the network, the PID controller outputs were used. 
                                        <br><br>
                                        The other algorithm we developed was a way for the robot to find its location on a circle using Monte Carlo localization. We attached a range sensor to the side 
                                        of the robot and set up wooden blocks in positions around the circle. We also attached an encoder to the wheel of the robot. The robot would internally create 
                                        points around the circle and continuously move around the circle. As it moves, the points would be weighted according to the sensor readings.

                                        For a class, two other friends and I made our own simple synthetic keyboard. We used a microcontroller board called a NUCLEO and other components that were part of our lab kit. 
                                        Additionally, we bought a pair of small speakers from Amazon. The components for the project included a LCD screen, a digital to analog converter, an amplifier, and push buttons. 
                                        I mainly worked on the hardware portion of the project with wiring and making an enclosure so our project looked good and did not fall apart. There are 17 keys in total, which 
                                        equates to around an octave and a half of keys. We used mainly a version of C for the code with an IDE called STM32. There were some improvements we could have made, but ran out 
                                        of time to complete those extra tasks.

                                        I made a website project using React and Flask. The app is a website to create an online deck for the card game Yu-Gi-Oh. 
                                        A logged in user is allowed to create and edit a deck. For editing a deck, the user needs to search a specific card name 
                                        and it will be added to the deck. The deck display will show a picture of all cards in the main, extra, and side decks. 
                                        Any user logged in or not is able to view all decks on the app and download the ydk file if needed. The ydk file allows for 
                                        integration with online games, allowing the The Flask database is used to store user and deck information.

                                I like to build models in my spare time, usually plastic fisgures and robots. I started building around 2016 and kept up with it until now. I like it because at the end, I have 
                                something physical that I can either display or mess with. I really like working with physical objects, and building models helps me to keep my hands moving and creating something
                                that I can show off in the end.
                                <br>

                                Recently, I started learning how to 3D print using a FDM printer. The printer uses plastic wire and melts the plastic to create layers. A 3D model can be broken up into layers
                                and the printer can take the layers of the model and build it using the melted plastic. I usually just download things off the internet but I began looking into creating some 3D 
                                models on my own using CAD, or computer aided design. The program itself allows the user to draw something on a plane and then extrude it to make a 3D model. By using a combination
                                of this and some other tools, I can make models that I designed and then print them to see them in a physical reality.

                                I started going to the archery club at my school and went to shoots at the local shooting range in town. I wanted to try some kind of physical activity to give me 
                                a break from school. Archery intertested me and it is not very expensive to do if renting there. I'm still a beginner and just do it casually with some friends.
